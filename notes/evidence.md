This page is on the Bayesian evidence, with the notation $\text{Pr}(D \vert M)$; the probability of data $D$ under model $M$.

In an alternative way of writing Bayes' rule:

$$p(\Theta) = \frac{\mathcal{L}(\Theta)\pi(\Theta)}{\mathcal{Z}}$$

where $\mathcal{Z}=\int_{\Omega_{\Theta}} \mathcal{L}(\Theta)\pi(\Theta)~d\Theta$; i.e. the posterior $p(\Theta)$ is given by the normalized product of likelihood and prior, with $\Theta$ in the hypothesis space $\Omega_\Theta$. In essence, the posterior is just a vector of weights to $\Theta$.

The motivation behind this is to be able to compare between models $M$, which involves integration over _volumes_ of parameter space, as opposed to the surface sampled by conventional MCMC.

One way to do this is using (dynamic) [[nested-sampling]].
