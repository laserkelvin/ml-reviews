# conditional-distribution


A [[probability-distribution]] related to the [[marginal-distribution]], as the possible values of one variable given others.

$$P(x \vert y) = \frac{P(x,y)}{P(y)}$$

The law of total probability is given as $P(x) = \sum_y P(x \vert y)P(y)$, as a re-arranged version of the conditional likelihood. This is related to [[bayes-rule]].

Compared to marginal distributions, conditional distributions can be much more efficiently factored as [[decision trees]].

A [[linear-gaussian-model]] is an example of a conditional distribution model.
