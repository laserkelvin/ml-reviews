# uncertainty

- #aleatoric uncertainty is statistical uncertainty, i.e. in the frequentist view noisy measurements.
- #epistemic uncertainty is systematic uncertainty, i.e. model aspects not considered, such as physical constraints like gravity, etc.


## Reinforcement learning

In the context of [[reinforcement learning]], according to [[decision-making-book]] uncertainty comprises:

- outcome uncertainty
  - what effect will our action have
- model uncertainty
  - our model of the problem is uncertain
- state uncertainty
  - the true state is uncertain
  - can be modelled as a [[partially-observable-markov-decision-process]]
- interaction uncertainty
  - behavior of other agents is uncertain
