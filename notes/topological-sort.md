# topological-sort


Sorting nodes of a graph to form an acyclic directed graph in the order they appear. For example, if $A \rightarrow C$ and $B \rightarrow C$, then $A,B$ should come before $C$, although not necessarily in a unique order between the two; there are two possible topological sorts for this.
