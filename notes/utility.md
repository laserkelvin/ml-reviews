# utility

The "worth" in a decision

Need to unify with the algorithms book, but the wikipedia definition seems pretty intuitive; the utility $U$ corresponds to the expectation value of the reward $x$, with probabilities $p$:

$$U(p) = \sum p_k x_k$$

...and "rational decisions" are basically those that maximize the expected reward.
