# bayesian-network-scoring

This is basically model selection, for [[bayesian-network]] models.

The idea is to infer the probability $P(G \vert D)$ for model graph $G$ and data $D$. Apparently this is [[NP-hard]].

One computes the Bayesian score:

$$\log(G \vert D) = \logP(G) + \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^{q_i}(\log(\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_{ij0})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{ij0} + m_{ij0})}) + \sum_{k=1}^{r_i}\log(\frac{\Gamma(\alpha_{ijk} + m_{ijk})}{\Gamma(\alpha_{ijk})}))$$

Each graph can then be ascribed a score, representing which graphs do better in representing the data.

With a scoring function, you can then perform searches for optimal graphs. It seems that finding globally optimal graphs are NP-hard, and the number of possible directed acyclic graphs scales superexponentially.

To counter this, there are a number of approximations that can be made, for example exploiting local symmetries like Markov equivalence[^1], or searching local neighborhoods (i.e. local graph operations like directivity, edge removal/creation).

[^1]: Two graphs are Markov equivalent if they are the same when undirected, or if they don't have the "immoral" v-structure (e.g. X -> Z <- Y>).
